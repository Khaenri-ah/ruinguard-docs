# RuinGuard

Welcome to Ruinguard!

If you are here, it means you wish to learn how to make a Discord bot.
Or make modules for other Ruinguard based bots.

And you have come to right place!

In this Guide we will cover various topics (and also refer some guides of Official Discord.js)

## Before you begin...

There are some prerequisites to making a bot. Its highly recommended to have a prior knowledge of JavaScript. While you *can* make a bot with little JS & programming language, but if you come across an error, its gonna hinder your bot/module making process. 

If you don't know JavaScript but would like to learn about it, here are a few links to help get you started:

* [Eloquent JavaScript, a free online book](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)
* [JavaScript.info, a modern javascript tutorial](https://javascript.info/)
* [Codecademy's interactive JavaScript course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-javascript)
* [Nodeschool, for both JavaScript and Node.js lessons](https://nodeschool.io/)
* [MDN's JavaScript guide and full documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript)
